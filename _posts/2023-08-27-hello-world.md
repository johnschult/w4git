## Origin

What is the orogin of "hello, world"? According to Wikipedia[^hello-world]:

> While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the 1978 book [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language), with likely earlier use in [BCPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL). The example program in that book prints "hello, world", and was inherited from a 1974 [Bell Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) internal memorandum by [Brian Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan), [Programming in C: A Tutorial](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/ctut.pdf).

```c
main() {
  printf("hello, world");
}
```

Interesting, but what does that have to do with Ham Radio? As this is the first post on my Ham Radio blog, "hello, world" seemed appropriate. Calling "CQ" is a lot like saying "hello, world".
